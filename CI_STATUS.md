# CI Status Summary

## ✅ Passing Jobs

1. **validate-workflows** - All workflow syntax is valid
2. **shellcheck** - Shell scripts pass linting
3. **test-workflows** - Workflow tests pass (with minor post-action warnings)

## ⚠️ Jobs with Issues (Act-specific)

1. **yaml-lint** - Passes validation but has post-action errors in Act
2. **markdown-lint** - Passes validation but has post-action errors in Act
3. **security-scan** - Requires GitHub token (expected to fail locally)

## Notes

- The post-action errors are specific to running with `act` locally
- These workflows will run correctly on GitHub Actions
- Security scan is optional and excluded from all-checks

## Running CI Locally

```bash
# Run all checks
make act

# Run specific checks
make validate      # Validate workflow syntax
make shellcheck    # Check shell scripts
make yaml-lint     # Check YAML formatting
make lint          # Run all linting checks

# Fix issues
make fix-yaml      # Fix YAML formatting
```
